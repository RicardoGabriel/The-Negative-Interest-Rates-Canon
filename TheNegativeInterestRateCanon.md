## <b id="b1"> What is an interest rate?</b> [↩] (#i1)

Before explaining in more detail how negative interest rates work, one must understand what an interest rate is. 


[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GHHesANT6OM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHesANT6OM)


In simple terms, interest is a fee paid by someone who borrows money to the lender, which is the person he borrows it from (it can be seen as the cost of borrowing money). The amount of interest paid is determined by the value of the chosen interest rate: [#] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeRNlGw8VF8)

For example, if you borrow €100 one year ago at a nominal interest rate of 10% per year, you will pay back to the lender today €110 which is the sum of the amount you asked (€100) and the interest paid on it (100x10%=€10).

Now, picture that upside-down World, where instead of paying interest you are actually receiving its value! Assuming  a nominal negative interest rate of (-10%), instead of paying back €110 you would only pay back €90. Sounds crazy right? 


During the last months, everyone has been hearing on the news people talking about negative interest rates. However, no one really knows what this means and what the real consequences are for both households and economy. Although consumers have never been confronted with negative nominal interest rates, the banking sector is experiencing them. How this will affect you and the economy as a whole is what we will address in this canon.


## <b id="b2"> How do interest rates work in a *simplified* financial system? </b> [↩] (#i2)

Firstly, consider a *simplified* financial environment within a country (or region). It is mainly composed by three agents: a <b id="a3">[Central Bank](#f3)</b>, <b id="a4">[Commercial Banks](#f4)</b> and consumers, just like you.

These three agents are highly interconnected in such a way that a lending/borrowing rate that one sets affects the others. The flowchart given below explains this relationship:

[![Image1.png](http://s17.postimg.org/d344bu14f/Image1.png)](http://postimg.org/image/os83zss2z/)

Starting with the Central Bank, besides setting <b id="a6">[monetary policy](#f6)</b> for a region, it also sets the policy rates (the official bank (lending) rate and deposit rate) for the Commercial Banks (relation 1). Most Central Banks demand that Commercial Banks maintain a minimum level of <b id="a5">[reserves](#f5)</b> (so called required reserves) in order to meet their operating needs and as a measure of safety for unexpected events such as huge cash withdrawals by Consumers. Central Banks pay interest on excess reserves, those above the required minimum, at the *official deposit rate* (relation 1). In this scenario, a negative deposit rate means that Banks are charged for saving their excess reserves.

However there may be some Commercial Banks that need help meeting their reserve requirement and, as a last resort, they may borrow from the Central Bank at the *official lending rate* (relation 1). Here, a negative lending rate implies that borrowing is now cheaper for Commercial Banks.

To meet reserve requirements, Commercial Banks can also borrow from one another at the so-called interbank market (overnight) rate (relation 2). This rate is closely determined by the policy rates set by the Central Bank, where its deposit rate acts as a floor (when lending to other Banks, Commercial Banks will charge at least as much as they would earn by saving the same amount at the Central Bank) and its lending rate acts as a ceiling (as Banks would not want to pay more to borrow from other Banks than what they would pay the Central Bank). In this context, a negative interbank rate implies that although Banks can borrow more cheaply from each other, they also have to pay interest on the excess liquidity they loan out to other Banks, keeping the net profit zero.

Finally, this interbank rate (or the borrowing cost for Commercial Banks) determines the borrowing rates for Consumers (relation 3). A negative borrowing rate may sound really attractive as you are *paid to borrow*, but the net effect on consumers is uncertain if Banks decide to compensate it by charging a deposit fee for the negative interest rates they face. [#] (http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/macroeconomic-insights-folder/negative-interest-rates-101/img-01-slide.png)

To sum up, the three entities presented above are interconnected in such a way that a rate set by the Central Banks influences the other two. Look at the following graph, where we plotted real data on these 4 types of rates for the Eurozone:

[![Image2.png](http://s11.postimg.org/chpj79dxf/Image2.png)](http://postimg.org/image/ivemaiitb/)

For instance, if the rate on the deposits at the Central Bank increases, then Banks will lend to one another at a higher rate, making its costs of borrowing higher, and therefore the rate at which consumers borrow may also increase. However, a higher interbank borrowing rate does not necessarily imply an equally higher consumer borrowing rate as shown in the graph above, as it is determined by other factors such as the Bank’s operating costs, credit risk, regulatory requirements etc. 


## <b id="b3"> Why would Central Banks set interest rates negative?</b> [↩] (#i3)

In periods of deep deflation (price levels fall), consumer spending and investment tend to be lower, slowing down the <b id="a9">[aggregate demand](#f9)</b> and production and increasing unemployment. To face this problems, Central Banks usually used  <b id="a10">[expansionary monetary policies](#f10)</b>. However, it might be the case that simply using *<b id="a6">[conventional monetary policy](#f6)</b>* or even keeping Central Bank’s interest rate at a <b id="a20">[zero lower bound](#f20)</b> and using *<b id="a7">[quantitative easing](#f7)</b>* is not enough to boost the economy, which may be in a <b id="a21">[liquidity trap](#f21)</b>. When this happens, using negative nominal interest rate policy might be a solution. As one may have noticed, several Central Banks have been adopting it as a measure of last resort.

Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, when an economy is stagnated, negative interest rates main goal is to encourage consumer spending and investment, through reduced borrowing costs for companies and households, increasing the number of loans made.

First, it is important to clarify why lending becomes cheaper and how Central Banks incentivize Commercial Banks to lend more. Remember that Commercial Banks keep reserves at Central Banks and they expect to receive interest on the excess reserves. When these deposit interest rates go negative, Banks prefer to earn some interest income on loans instead of paying interest on excess reserves at Central Banks. On the other hand, this also probably leads to lower funding cost for Commercial Banks, encouraging them to borrow more from one another. 

Secondly, these lower interest rates actually aim to incentivize consumer spending. Under such circumstances, any household would prefer spending money on desired goods and services rather than paying to keep savings in the Bank. This would contribute to higher aggregate demand and production while improving economic growth.

Finally, such situation would incentivize investment due to the low cost of funding, since the interest rates charged to the general public could also decrease. Therefore, companies could easily invest in new facilities or R&D for instance and entrepreneurs could start new businesses.

Another relevant consequence of negative interest rates is that the currency becomes weaker. For instance, knowing that investors seek high-interest rates to get the highest possible return on their investments and if national interest rates are negative, one may conclude that investors will try to exchange national currency for foreign currency (to invest in some foreign activity that yields higher return). On the one hand, if many investors try to get rid of a national currency, then naturally its value will decrease, leading to lower purchasing power - foreign imports would become more expensive in terms of national currency. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the foreign currency will increase, meaning that national exports would become cheaper when expressed in this foreign currency. All of this together would boost national exports – national products became cheaper for foreigners and its demand would therefore increase – and increase <b id="a2">[inflation](#f2)</b> – since national households would pay more for the same imported goods after all.

So far, there is *no clear distinction between using low or negative nominal interest rates*, as it is even considered by some economists a conventional monetary policy. [#] (http://ner.sagepub.com/content/234/1/R5.refs) However, it is expected that the negative interest rates reinforce and achieve the expected results of using low interest rates at a faster pace. [#] (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160615.en.html) 
Some Central Banks have even started replacing the term zero lower bound on nominal interest rates for *effective lower bound, which may well be less than zero. By how much? We do not know, but probably not that far from zero. The lowest nominal policy rate among the Central Banks with negative rates today can be found in Denmark and Switzerland - currently negative 0.75 percent.* [#Fed] (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161005a.htm#fn6) [#ECB] (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2015/html/sp150519.en.html)


Hence, when setting negative interest rates, **Central Banks aim to improve economic growth, increase inflation, demand and output and decrease unemployment**, through implicit lower borrowing costs for Banks and consumers.


[Here] (http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-central-banks/#2) is a little comic by *Bloomberg* that explains in a simple way *How to get banks to put their money to work with the possibility of negative interest rates existence*.

## <b id="b4">What are the consequences of the use of negative interest rates for: </b> [↩] (#i4)

* <b id="b5">**Consumers:**</b> [↩] (#i5)

In general, negative interest rates set by Central Banks are expected to lower rates for both corporates and households, which may lead to higher levels of consumption and investment. However, one must keep in mind that these lending rates have never been negative for consumers and nothing tells us this will change in the future. So, when Central Banks set depositing interest rates negative, consumers may not experience them directly, but rather just consequences of the decrease in interest rates.  


Negative interest rates policy aim to support price stability by further easing monetary and financial conditions and encourage the private sector to spend more, instead of saving. [#] (https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/04/10/the-broader-view-the-positive-effects-of-negative-nominal-interest-rates/) The rationale behind this is, as interest rate falls, rewards from saving decreases. For consumers it becomes relatively more attractive to hold their money with them or invest it. Borrowing is also more attractive, leading to an increase in spending, thereby helping the economy to recover. Negative interest rates have other **positive implications** on consumers.

Firstly, look at the transfer of resources from net savers to net borrowers. As net borrowers typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume (i.e. they consume more for every unit of income that they earn than net savers) they will buy more goods and services, leading to greater consumption and investment. 

Secondly, negative interest rates encourage loans taken to purchase automobiles and home mortgages. Due to this, Banks are expected to drop mortgages interest rates paid by consumer. This would positively affect the housing market as demand would increase considerably.



 
There are also certain **negative implications** associated with negative interest rates for Consumers.

Since under this policy Banks accept riskier loans, they may decide to compensate this risk by charging an extra fee on each loan they lend out, essentially passing on the costs to the consumers, who would end up not benefiting from the negative interest rates and not increasing consumption and investment. 


Although from a theoretical point of view consumers have less incentive to save, data show us the opposite has been happening. Recent economic data shows that in countries like Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden, countries experiencing the negative nominal interest rate policy, consumers are saving more. In fact in Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark the savings are at their highest since 1995. This is mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, if individuals’ retirement savings account stops paying interest or, in an extreme case, the effect reverses, savers will end up receiving less money that they expecting after retirement. To compensate this decrease, agents will probably have to save more in order to meet their retirement savings objectives and reduce consumption and investment. Secondly, people borrow and spend more only when they are certain about the future and implementing negative interest rate is like going into uncharted territory. Therefore resulting in a loss of consumer confidence, that will once again lead to consumers saving more instead of spending.  [#] (http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-negative-rates-backfiring-heres-some-early-evidence-1470677642) 


Negative interest rates may cause lots of problems to people who store money in Banks, especially to those who save for retirement. So, one might ask then why people should keep storing their money at the Bank knowing that in some periods time they will have a lower return than they expected. The reason is that, despite the losses, investing the money provides a safer alternative to consumers when compared to stashing away the cash in a mattress. As long as rates do not go too low, individuals will probably prefer depositing cash safely in a Bank, since keeping it outside a Bank can also be quite expensive (for example security measures). [#] (http://www.elliottwealth.com/HOT-TOPIC-The-World-Experiments-with-Negative-Interest-Rates.c7244.htm)


Due to the lower cost of funding and increase in amount of loans, negative interest rates bring more currency into circulation, leading to higher prices of goods and commodities. deposit cash assets safely in a Bank. This situation can also drive housing prices up in and create the fear of a “bubble.” [#] (http://www.elliottwealth.com/HOT-TOPIC-The-World-Experiments-with-Negative-Interest-Rates.c7244.htm) This might be suboptimal for the consumers specially for low-income group. 





Overall, the net effect that negative interest rates have on consumers is not crystal clear. While consumers can benefit when they are paid whenever they borrow, the same effect reverses if Banks charge them with a fee, causing the effective interest rate to be zero. [#1] (http://www.advisoryhq.com/articles/negative-interest-rates/) [#2] (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/080916/how-negative-interest-rates-can-affect-consumers.asp)

* <b id="b6">**Banks and other financial lenders:**</b> [↩] (#i6)

As with consumers, the negative interest rates have implications for Commercial Banks and other financial lenders. Many of these implications are similar to the ones for consumers but in a different light. Households, consumers, the financial market and the economy are highly interconnected as talked about previously. One of the main functions of the financial market is to transfer money from the households and savers to the borrowers, may it be other households, other Banks or even the government. Any implications of negative interest rates affect all players involved.

In the Eurozone, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan, the Central Banks have placed a negative rate on Commercial Banks excess reserves that are held as a deposit at the Central Bank. In other words, the Commercial Banks have to pay to place their money there. In such a case, it is better to look for positive returns at other places. [#] (https://www.ft.com/content/0048beea-766e-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a) [#] (http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32284393)

One of the **positive implications** behind the negative interest rate policies adopted by these Central Banks is to stimulate the economy by driving up investments, as we have previously mentioned. As it is not optimal to place their money at the Central Bank, the Commercial Banks go out in search for alternative <b id="a1">[assets](#f1)</b> and investments. Commercial Banks may use these extra funds on R&D investments and loans to entrepreneurs, for example. The Banks would also rather lend to one another, promoting interbank lending and allowing the financial market to partly finance itself.

Investments and the value of assets will then increase in the presence of negative interest rates as Commercial Banks, lenders and other investors look for more profitable assets. There is more <b id="a11">[liquidity](#f11)</b> in the financial market, what can be seen as a positive environment for Commercial Banks to be able to grow in and for the economy as a whole. [#1] (http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/9/3779.short) [#2] (http://smallbusiness.chron.com/liquidity-effect-economics-5212.html) Studies  have shown that finance and economic growth have a positive relationship. However, there are risks and  <b id="a12">[moral hazards](#f12)</b> involved. [#1] (https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2009/arc/pdf/adrian.pdf) [#2] (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr398.pdf) [#3] (http://www.bis.org/publ/work268.htm) [#4] (https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/44122/1/MPRA_paper_44115.pdf) [#5] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976910000645)


On the other hand, one may also find some **negative implications**. If consumers face negative interest rates, Bank’s profits would be drastically eroded. To avoid this situation, Banks would go in search of assets and investments with positive returns, probably ending up accepting riskier loans and assets. Banks would then loan to people that have a higher chance of not being able to pay it back, i.e. higher default risk. This phenomena is called ‘searching for yield’. 


This phenomena causes the overall likelihood of <b id="a13">[bank default](#f13)</b> to go up and <b id="a14">[asset bubbles](#f14)</b> to form. When the bubble bursts and Consumers start being unable to payback their loans, a Bank defaults as it is unable to pay back their liabilities (debts) due to not getting enough money from their borrowers. When a large enough bank defaults, it can cause <b id="a15">[bank runs](#f15)</b> and - as in the financial crisis of 2008-2009 - cause a financial crisis that can lead to a <b id="a8">[recession](#f8)</b>. Then, if Banks are not regulated optimally, it endangers the stability of the financial system as a whole. [#] (https://www.macroeconomics.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg124/Regulation/Hanson-Kashyap-Stein-2011.pdf)


To offset the negative impact of this policy and to keep their lending margins, Banks may take some extreme measures, as increasing the fees and commissions charged to the consumers and cut costs. In some countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, Banks have even passed negative rates to deposits of some large corporations and institutional investors, although maintaining positive ones for the average depositor. [#]
(https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16172.pdf)

For other financial lenders, when there are negative interest rates, they get less money back from their investments than what is actually lent out. Rationally, lenders would rather not lend out money. So, there would be a shortage of liquidity available to borrowers that would want to borrow due to the low cost of funding. This cash holding phenomena is important for Banks, as the depositors may rather hold cash at zero nominal interest rate and withdraw their deposits, also causing financial instability.


The effect of the implications of negative interest rates on banks and other financial lenders are two-sided. On the one hand, it stimulates financial and credit growth, and yet on the other, it can have adverse effects on their profits and the stability of the financial market.

## <b id="b8">Japan and Eurozone case-studies </b> [↩] (#i8)

Since Japanese asset bubble collapse in the early 1990s, **Japan** has been in an economic recession. It took 12 years for Japan's <b id="a22">[Gross Domestic Product](#f22)</b> (GDP) to recover to the same level as 1995. This is commonly known as the [lost decade] (http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/08/lost-decades) of Japan. Even in the current year of 2016, the country is experiencing weak economic growth, a stagnated price level and no increase in real wages.

Bank of Japan (BOJ) first tried to stimulate country’s economy with a zero interest rate and quantitative easing programs in 2001 [#] (https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2011/1018/ifdp1018.pdf). However, the result seemed to work only for a short period of time and disappeared in the long run, partly due to the global economic recession starting in 2008/2009. During this period, japanese GDP growth rate reached negative levels (-0.7% in 2008 and -5,2% in 2009) and their exports have decreased as well.

[![Image3.png](http://s21.postimg.org/nuzm5q5gn/Image3.png)](http://postimg.org/image/r1u5pcpwj/)

In December 2012, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office. Some weeks after it announced plans for a new suite of policies to boost Japan's economy, which became known as **Abenomics**. This set of economic policies, were based on three main pillars: more public spending, a reinforced quantitative easing program and more structural reforms. As we see in the graph, Abenomics achieved some of the proposed goals - for instance, it increased the inflation rate to the 2%. However, it did not promote the expected long run economic growth as GDP growth rate is still lower than 1%. [#] (http://www.cfr.org/japan/abenomics-japanese-economy/p30383)


For this reason, in early 2016, the BOJ decided to adopt a negative interest rate policy. The BOJ has not only cut interest rate on excess reserve deposits to minus 0.1%, as it still maintains the quantitative easing program.[#] (https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2004/data/wp04e08.pdf)

So far, the household consumption and business investment did not grow as expected. Although recently in July 2016 Japan has cut the GDP growth forecast to 0.9% in real term for the year through, predictions from IMF indicate a growth rate of only 0.5%. [#] (http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/14/business/economy-business/japans-2016-growth-forecast-cut-0-9-amid-uncertainty-slack-consumption-investment/#.WBC4uuB97IU) [#] (http://pt.knoema.com/igsdjtg/japan-gdp-growth-forecast-2015-2020-and-up-to-2060-data-and-charts)


Moreover, the negative rates policy has not done much to make businesses more productive or to help low-income households spending in Japan. Furthermore, although it might encourage Banks to lend more, it can’t create more creditworthy borrowers or attractive business investments and that is what Japan needs right now. [#] (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/080716/why-negative-interest-rates-are-still-not-working-japan.asp)


Some critics say that this set of policies might not be able to boost Japan’s economy due to the long term deflation and low growth, arguing that the BOJ may be running out of monetary policy tools to achieve these goals. However, the BOJ claims that there is no boundary and rates can be cut further as needed, also adding that additional measures to support a sustainable long term growth should be discussed as well - such as supporting immigration to boost Japanese workforce. Finally, we should mention that until now there is no clear proof or evidence about the overall effect of the use of negative interest rates.

______________

The **Eurozone** sovereign debt crisis began around 2008, when eurozone member states Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were unable to repay or refinance their government debt. Nearly five years after the onset of the global credit crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s key policy rates have been reduced close to their zero floors but the Eurozone’s economy was still producing well below its productive capacity - it was in a liquidity trap. [#] (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Econote/EcoNote_22_Zone_euro_EN.pdf)


[![Image4.png](http://s9.postimg.org/nm2gi2m2n/Image4.png)](http://postimg.org/image/56hzko7y3/)

With the single monetary policy from the ECB, Eurozone member states' governments could not independently make decisions regarding monetary policy to economically recover from the global financial crisis. Trying to achieve the target of 2% inflation and to spur economic growth, ECB cut policy rates (both deposit and lending rates) in several steps during 2012–2013. However, as the Eurozone’s growth had been weaker than expected, in June 2014 the ECB became the world’s first major Central Bank to launch negative interest rates, cutting its depositary interest rate to minus 0.1%. According to Mr Mario Draghi economic recovery at the beginning of 2016 had been slower than expected due to problems in emerging markets, financial volatility and slow implementation of economic reforms in the eurozone, leading to a further decrease of nominal interest rates to minus 0.4% in March 2016. [#] (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16172.pdf)
[#] (https://www.ft.com/content/9a45a960-e6ac-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39)

Representatives from the European Central Bank tell us that most of the consequences felt so far, point towards a successful achievement of economic growth. For instance, the net income of euro area significant banking groups actually increased between 2014 and 2015. [#] (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160728.en.html) Negative rates have significantly enhanced the signaling effect of the ECB’s monetary stance strengthening its forward guidance. Also, lowering the deposit rate has supported the portfolio rebalancing channel of the ECB’s asset purchase program by encouraging Banks to substitute investment in riskier assets for excess reserves. [#] (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16172.pdf)


Adding to the recent financial crisis, the reasons behind the ECB’s decision are quite similar to BOJ's ones. Both regions are mature economies with fewer investment opportunities and a similar demographic problem (the working age population is diminishing).[#] (http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/japan-in-transition-rest-of-world-watches-as-country-tries-negative-interest-rates-to-spur-economy) Although, in both cases it is difficult to say how long these low interest rates will continue and what the real consequences for the economies would be, the IMF expects the Eurozone to grow by 1.7% in 2016 and by 1.5% in 2017, while it expects Japanese economic growth to be 0.5% in 2016—the same as in 2015—and to pick up to 0.6% in 2017. [#1] (http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/06/negative-rates-will-stay-for-another-five-years-jpmorgan-warns.html) [#2] (http://marketrealist.com/2016/10/imf-revises-forecast-euro-zone-economic-growth/) [#3] (http://marketrealist.com/2016/10/imf-sees-improvement-japanese-economic-growth/)

## <b id="b9">Are there any alternatives?</b> [↩] (#i9)

Given all the limitations of negative interest rates, one may ask himself if there are alternatives to their use. Economies can not only be stimulated by monetary policy, but also by **<b id="a16">[fiscal policy](#f16)</b>**. Governments have their own revenue, generated from taxes paid by households and firms, and also spend a lot of money, on transfers and subsidies for example. 

Fiscal policy is a tool used by Governments to target the value and composition of government spending and revenue. For example, in a period of recession and high unemployment level, governments may decide to lower taxes and increase spending (expansionary fiscal policy) to stimulate consumption and investment and spur economic growth. On the other way around, in periods of high inflation, governments may decide to increase taxes and reduce government spending. This idea is supported by Keynesian Economics in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money(1936) by John Maynard Keynes.


Some economists claim that, instead of relying so much on monetary policy boost the economic growth, governments should use fiscal policy to overcome stagnation. However, one must also consider all its limitations.

First, although several economists such as John Keynes argued that budget deficits may be useful to overcome periods of recession, in reality fiscal policy is somehow limited when a
<b id="a17">[budget deficit](#f17)</b> is already considerably high. We can think for example about <b id="a19">[Stability and Growth Pact](#f19)</b> in European Union, which defines as an excessive budget deficit as one greater than 3 % of GDP. Countries that fail to respect the its preventive or corrective rules may ultimately face sanctions. [#1] (http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/KeynesianEconomics.html) [#2] (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm)

Second, if in this case Governments choose to use an expansionary fiscal policy anyway (increase government spending and/or decrease taxes), it will run into an even higher budget deficit. This might mean that, in the future, the government will raise taxes and decrease spending to pay this debt. Moreover, households may be aware of this situation and, instead of spending the money they accumulated from the previous decrease in taxes, they will save it to face its future increase.

To sum up, although Fiscal Policy can be seen as an instrument to spur economic growth, under certain circumstances, it also has some limitations and might end up not having the desired consequences. [#1] (http://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/fiscal-policy/fiscal_policy/) [#2] (https://media.spglobal.com/documents/SPGlobal_Negative_Interest_Rates_August_2016.pdf pages 14-16)

Another alternative to negative interest rates is described in Milton Friedman’s theory Helicopter Drop - **Helicopter Money**. In his famous paper The Optimum Quantity of Money, Friedman says > Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.< [#]  (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/what-is-helicopter-money/)

Within the frameworks of today’s economies, this idea could be materialized by allowing the Central Banks to transfer money directly to households, by crediting their Bank  accounts for instance. By doing so, Central Banks would be stimulating demand, inflation and probably economic growth. However, some people argue that actually helicopter money works as fiscal policy and not as a monetary policy. As it is known, Central Banks are only in charge of monetary policy and strictly forbidden to interfere with fiscal policy. Therefore, such measure would be extremely controversial. [#] (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/what-is-helicopter-money/)

Helicopter money can also be interpreted as tax cuts financed by monetary policy. Ben Bernanke and Willem Buiter defend that the government could decrease taxes if Central Banks commit to purchase government debt. It is important to distinguish this from quantitative easing. With quantitative easing Central Banks buy assets that the governments have to pay back. However, according to this theory, the bonds issued by the governments would be <b id="a18">[perpetual bonds](#f18)</b> at an interest rate of zero. Therefore, while the Central Bank would buy and hold these assets forever, the governments would not have to pay back the loan neither interest. [#] (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/upshot/helicopter-money-why-some-economists-are-talking-about-dropping-money-from-the-sky.html?_r=0) 

However, as Willem Buiter claims, coordination between the Central Bank and the government is required for the real-world implementation of helicopter money drops. The fact that governments may get used to get this type funding to finance investments or tax cuts and that this could also lead to an inflation rate much higher than the 2% currently desired also concern policy makers and economists.

<b id="f18">**Perpetual Bonds:**</b> Let us assume that you bought a 10% annual coupon bond which will give you $1000 at the maturity date. Let say that the maturity date is 5 years from now. So you will get $100 every year as interest and after 5 years you will get $1000 as well. A Perpetual bond is a bond which has no maturity date. So you will not get that $1000 after 5 years but the advantage is that you will receive a steady stream of interest payments forever. Usually the interest rate on such bonds are low.
